### Welcome to my profile 👋
I'm a **Rust** software developer based in Kyiv, Ukraine 🇺🇦 with a background in building robust backend systems — from in-house ad servers and RTB platforms to integrating a variety of payment systems.

My professional toolkit includes **Rust** as the main focus, but I’ve also worked commercially with **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and **Elm**, and casually explored **C** and **Assembly** for fun and learning.

### 🎙️ Vibing with audio & code

In the ad tech world, DSP stands for **Demand Side Platform** — something I’ve built and scaled more than once.  
But in my spare time, it means **Digital Signal Processing** — a space where I love experimenting with audio synthesis and sound manipulation.

When I'm not crafting high-performance systems in Rust, I'm likely building tools that make sound come alive.  

You can explore some of my audio (and other tech) experiments [here](https://blog.paramako.com/)
